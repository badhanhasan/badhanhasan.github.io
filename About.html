		<p align="center">Hello! My name is Badhan Hasan. I graduated from Times Squarred STEM Academy and now I am a freshman in the University of Rhode Island. I am majoring in computer science and because of that I was required to make this website. I have done coding in the past and because of that I was able to add in gradients and such. I have added 2 pictures of myself on the top and in the bottom I have a picture of the Statue of Liberty and below that I have a picture of a nice foggy morning. I love visting places and taking walks.</p>
